    <h1>FPGA & ESP32 Projects</h1>
    <p>This repository showcases a collection of projects designed for both practical applications and learning, including low-level and embedded software, HDL RTL code, FPGA design, and workflow, as well as hands-on breadboard prototyping.</p>

        Complete implementation of a 'smart' air conditioner remote, covering both hardware and software aspects.
        <br>
        The project encompassed everything from down at the IR signal level to the development of a frontend Android app.
        <br><br>
        Through this project, I worked on and improved the following skills:
        <ul>
		<li>Embedded programming: working within an established software framework</li>
		<li>Computer networks: setting up an HTTPS web server and making it accessible online using a reverse proxy</li>
		<li>IR signal analysis: understanding the encoding and signal structure used by my AC</li>
		<li>Web development: frontend UI/UX design</li>
		<li>Frontend and backend interoperability</li>
	</ul>
